# gitspeak
A repository to gather statistics of entire GitHub by language usage

What languages are really popular?
As I don't believe in Tiobe rating, I decided to measure languages popularity by scanning languages usage in public GitHub repos.
This should be much more adequate rating, than measusuring language popularity by tags in questions.
As for me, there is only 1 drawback: Private and corporate repos. It is simply impossible to gather statistics from there, as they are not public visible. Also, not all the code is published to GitHub, but as it is the biggest Git platform, it can be considered as "trend-setter"

## Stats
This script is still running, so i would update stats for some period of time
